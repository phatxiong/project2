			<div class="post" id="p1"><b>BOTANICAL PAPER ARTIST</b> Kate Kato continues to use found and recycled paper to build intricate natural dioramas. A buzzing hive of bees makes a home in a matchbox, vintage books are overgrown with paper fungi and colorful wildflowers, and a shadow box is filled with butterflies and beetles.</div>
			<div class="post" id="p2">Rather than <em>striving</em> for exact scientific replication, Kato allows the original material to show through, lending a spirit of handcrafted whimsy to her work. Some of the pieces seen here can be purchased through <a class="link" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/Kasasagi?ref=l2-shopheader-name" target="none">Etsy</a>, and you can explore more of the Wales-based artist’s work on <a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/kasasagi.design/about/?ref=page_internal" target="none">Facebook</a>, and <a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/kasasagi.design/" target="none">Instagram</a>.</div>	
			<div class="post" id="p3"><p>Influenced by a childhood fascination with botanical illustrations and collecting bits of natural ephemera, artist Kate Kato crafts detailed sculptures of the various mushrooms, flowers, and beetles found within the Welsh valley where she currently resides. The sculptures are typically built to accurately reflect the size of their subject, each constructed out of recycled bits of paper that Kato tints with natural dyes.<p><p>“For me my work can be very nostalgic, taking me back to my childhood and the curiosity that fueled my creativity,” said Kato in her artist statement. “I like to use recycled paper as it reflects that nostalgia, and gives the sculptures a history and narrative. I like people to be able to see where the materials have come from, as well as what I have turned them into, evoking that childish curiosity we all have somewhere inside!”</p></div>
