			<div class="subhead" id="introo">Chemistry, Artificial Intelligence, and Interactivity to Create “Living” Architecture / 10.08.17</div>
			<div class="post" id="p1"><b>MULTIDISCIPLINARY ARTIST AND ARCHITECT</b> Philip Beesley weaves together such a broad array of technologies and systems in his artworks that they legitimately defy description, but the immediate impact of encountering these sprawling interactive installations is visceral and awe-inspiring. </div>
			<div class="post" id="ph2">His latest work, Astrocyte, connects chemistry, artificial intelligence, and an immersive soundscape to create a living piece of architecture that responds to the presence of viewers. Comprised of 300,000 individual components, the piece was on view against the industrial backdrop at Toronto’s port lands for <a class="link" href="http://editdx.org/home">EDIT: Expo for Design, Innovation & Technology</a> last October.</div>	
			<div class="post" id="ph3">The piece further incorporates 3D-printed lighting components and masses of custom glasswork that contain a combination of oil, inorganic chemicals, and other solutions to form a sort of chemical skin. At the core of Beesley research is the question of whether architecture can <em>truly be “alive,”</em> opening the possibility for self-repairing structures or deeply responsive organic environments, where artificial intelligence exists at almost every level of design. Regardless of the complexity and heady ideas, the works are deeply aesthetically intriguing, something directly out of science fiction.</div>
			<div class="post" id="ph4">Beesley is the director of the <a class="link" href="http://livingarchitecturesystems.com/" target="none">Living Architecture Systems Group</a> and a professor at the School of Architecture at the University of Waterloo. You can explore much more of his work on his <a class="link" href="http://philipbeesleyarchitect.com/sculptures/index.php" target="none">website</a> and along with several videos and interviews on <a class="link" href="https://vimeo.com/search?q=philip+beesley" target="none">Vimeo</a>.</div>
